## Advanced Video Controls for Crunchyroll

- A Chrome extension that adds playback 1.25x / 1.5x/ 2x speed controls to Crunchyroll's video player.

# Motivation

- I built this extension while watching One Piece, a series known for its pacing issues. Crunchyroll's video player currently doesn't offer playback speeds above 1x. While existing extensions provide this functionality through an extension popup, I wanted the playback speed controls to feel native to Crunchyroll by integrating them directly into the video player.

# How It Works

- The extension injects a content script into Crunchyroll's video player page. This script hides the existing playback speed menu and adds a new playback speed menu with additional speed options, allowing users to select from 1.25x, 1.5x, and 2x playback speeds. The extension also listens for changes in the video player's state to ensure that the controls remain synchronized with the current playback speed.
